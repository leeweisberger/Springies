  Superclass Masses:
    add to initialize object with a mass, x and y coordinates, collision id
    hit() to detect collisions with walls/floor/ceiling
  	Possibly a method that allows it to be picked up and manipulated by the mouse
  	Subclass Moving Mass:
  	  add() to add xvelocity and yvelocity
  	  move() to update x and y coordinate
  	  A method to allow forces to act on it such as gravity, viscosity
  	  



  Superclass Spring 
	  add() to initialize the object with a mass, x and y coordinate, springiness, a rest length, and an amplitude (for regular springs, amplitude=0)
	  Need to change movement of masses when stretching/compressing (shorter than or longer than rest length)  
	  Need to change angle when masses that it is connected to move. Changing angle involves updating the x and y coordinates
	  SubClass Muscles:
	    Need to move in harmonic motion depending on amplitude
